zhoji's Personal & Academic Site
===

To develop my own personal and academic website, I forked [this repo](https://academicpages.github.io/) from Academic Pages (a GitHub Pages template for personal and professional portfolio-oriented websites) and then added my own twist to it :)

Notes
---

**For running locally:** Run `jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change. You may also try `bundle exec jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to ensure jekyll to use specific dependencies on your own local machine.
