Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.}, ISSN={1522-2586}, DOI={10.1002/jmri.28145}, abstractNote={Background Paraspinal musculature (PSM) is increasingly recognized as a contributor to low back pain (LBP), but with conventional MRI sequences, assessment is limited. Chemical shift encoding-based water–fat MRI (CSE-MRI) enables the measurement of PSM fat fraction (FF), which may assist investigations of chronic LBP. Purpose To investigate associations between PSM parameters from conventional MRI and CSE-MRI and between PSM parameters and pain. Study Type Prospective, cross-sectional. Population Eighty-four adults with chronic LBP (44.6 ± 13.4 years; 48 males). Field Strength/Sequence 3-T, T1-weighted fast spin-echo and iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least squares estimation sequences. Assessment T1-weighted images for Goutallier classification (GC), muscle volume, lumbar indentation value, and muscle-fat index, CSE-MRI for FF extraction (L1/2–L5/S1). Pain was self-reported using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Intra- and/or interreader agreement was assessed for MRI-derived parameters. Statistical Tests Mixed-effects and linear regression models to 1) assess relationships between PSM parameters (entire cohort and subgroup with GC grades 0 and 1; statistical significance α = 0.0025) and 2) evaluate associations of PSM parameters with pain (α = 0.05). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for intra- and/or interreader agreement. Results The FF showed excellent intra- and interreader agreement (ICC range: 0.97–0.99) and was significantly associated with GC at all spinal levels. Subgroup analysis suggested that early/subtle changes in PSM are detectable with FF but not with GC, given the absence of significant associations between FF and GC (P-value range: 0.036 at L5/S1 to 0.784 at L2/L3). Averaged over all spinal levels, FF and GC were significantly associated with VAS scores. Data Conclusion In the absence of FF, GC may be the best surrogate for PSM quality. Given the ability of CSE-MRI to detect muscle alterations at early stages of PSM degeneration, this technique may have potential for further investigations of the role of PSM in chronic LBP.

Transient and stable transfection are two methods that are often used for exogenous gene expression. Transient transfection is only useful for short-term expression, whereas stable transfection allows exogenous genes to be integrated into the host cell genome where it will be continuously expressed. As a result, stable transfection is usually employed for research into long-term genetic regulation. Here we describe a simple protocol to generate a stable cell line overexpressing tagged death receptor 3 (DR3) to explore DR3 function. We picked single clones after a retroviral infection in order to maintain the homogeneity and purity of the stable cell lines. The stable cell lines generated using this protocol render DR3-deficient HT29 cells sensitive to antimitotic drugs, thus reconstituting the apoptotic response in HT29 cells. Moreover, the FLAG tag on DR3 compensates for the unavailability of good DR3 antibody and facilitates the biochemical study of the molecular mechanism by which antimitotic agents induce apoptosis.}, number={143}, journal={Journal of Visualized Experiments (JoVE)}, author={Wang, Xin and Zhou, Jiamin and Qi, Chen and Wang, Gelin}, year={2019}, month=jan, pages={e58705}, language={en} }

Predator odor 2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT) and its potent analog 2-methyl-2-thiazoline (2MT) are believed to activate specific odorant receptors to elicit innate fear/defensive behaviors in naive mice. Here, we conduct a large-scale recessive genetics screen of ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-mutagenized mice. We find that loss of Trpa1, a pungency/irritancy receptor, diminishes TMT/2MT and snake skin-evoked innate fear/defensive responses. Accordingly, Trpa1−/−mice fail to effectively activate known fear/stress brain centers upon 2MT exposure, despite their apparent ability to smell and learn to fear 2MT. Moreover, Trpa1 acts as a chemosensor for 2MT/TMT and Trpa1-expressing trigeminal ganglion neurons contribute critically to 2MT-evoked freezing. Our results indicate that Trpa1-mediated nociception plays a crucial role in predator odor-evoked innate fear/defensive behaviors. The work establishes the first forward genetics screen to uncover the molecular mechanism of innate fear, a basic emotion and evolutionarily conserved survival mechanism.}, number={1}, journal={Nature Communications}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Wang, Yibing and Cao, Liqin and Lee, Chia-Ying and Matsuo, Tomohiko and Wu, Kejia and Asher, Greg and Tang, Lijun and Saitoh, Tsuyoshi and Russell, Jamie and Klewe-Nebenius, Daniela and Wang, Li and Soya, Shingo and Hasegawa, Emi and Chérasse, Yoan and Zhou, Jiamin and Li, Yuwenbin and Wang, Tao and Zhan, Xiaowei and Miyoshi, Chika and Irukayama, Yoko and Cao, Jie and Meeks, Julian P. and Gautron, Laurent and Wang, Zhiqiang and Sakurai, Katsuyasu and Funato, Hiromasa and Sakurai, Takeshi and Yanagisawa, Masashi and Nagase, Hiroshi and Kobayakawa, Reiko and Kobayakawa, Ko and Beutler, Bruce and Liu, Qinghua}, year={2018}, month=may, pages={2041}, language={en} }

However, manual segmentation of vertebral bodies is time consuming and laborious.


Purpose: (1) Develop a deep learning pipeline for segmentation of vertebral bodies using quantitative water-fat MRI. (2) Compare BMF measurements between manual and automatic segmentation methods to assess performance.


Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, MR images using a 3D spoiled gradient-recalled echo (SPGR) sequence with Iterative Decomposition of water and fat with Echo Asymmetry and Least-squares estimation (IDEAL) reconstruction algorithm were obtained in 57 subjects (28 women, 29 men, mean age, 47.2 ± 12.6 years). An artificial network was trained for 100 epochs on a total of 165 lumbar vertebrae manually segmented from 31 subjects. Performance was assessed by analyzing the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision-recall, F1 scores, specificity, sensitivity, and similarity metrics. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess performance of BMF fraction quantification using the predicted segmentations.


Results: The deep learning segmentation method achieved an AUC of 0.92 (CI 95%: 0.9186, 0.9195) on a testing dataset (n = 24 subjects) on classification of pixels as vertebrae. A sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.80 were achieved for a testing dataset, and a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.849 ± 0.091. Comparing manual and automatic segmentations on fat fraction maps of lumbar vertebrae (n = 124 vertebral bodies) using Bland-Altman analysis resulted in a bias of only −0.605% (CI 95% = −0.847 to −0.363%) and agreement limits of −3.275% and +2.065%. Automatic segmentation was also feasible in 16 ± 1 s.


Conclusion: Our results have demonstrated the feasibility of automated segmentation of vertebral bodies using deep learning models on water-fat MR (Dixon) images to define vertebral regions of interest with high specificity. These regions of interest can then be used to quantify BMF with comparable results as manual segmentation, providing a framework for completely automated investigation of vertebral changes in CLBP.}, journal={Frontiers in Endocrinology}, publisher={Frontiers}, author={Zhou, Jiamin and Damasceno, Pablo F. and Chachad, Ravi and Cheung, Justin R. and Ballatori, Alexander and Lotz, Jeffrey C. and Lazar, Ann A. and Link, Thomas M. and Fields, Aaron J. and Krug, Roland}, year={2020}, month=sep, language={English} }
